#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. In simulation window the motion of position diagram, velocity and acceleration diagram is shown.
2. There are pointers given on right side of the screen under the variable tab to change the values of r1, r2, r3, r4 and theta 2, and navigation, play/pause and reverse button under control tab. Navigation buttons given on the simulator screen for the navigation of the simulator screen.
