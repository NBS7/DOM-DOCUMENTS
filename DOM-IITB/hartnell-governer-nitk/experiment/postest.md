b. The fly ball tilts away from the governor axis at maximum position<br>
<b>c. All of the above</b><br>

Q 2. In a spring-controlled governor, the curve of controlling force is a straight line. When balls are 35 cm apart the controlling force is 1100 N and when 20 cm apart it is 550 N. To make the governor isochronous, the required initial tension on the spring would be _____ N.<br>
a. 91.25<br>
<b>b. 183.5</b><br>
c. 200<br>

Q 3. The total sleeve movement in a Hartnell governor is 3 cm. The mass of rotating balls is 1.5 kg each. At the mid position of the sleeve arm, which is 6.5 cm long, is horizontal. The ball arm has a length of 7.5 cm. At the mid position of the sleeve, the ball rotates at a radius of 10.5 cm. Due to the maladjustment of spring, the equilibrium speed of governor at top position is 415 rpm and in the lowest position, it is 430 rpm. The stiffness of the spring will be __________<br>
<b>a. 6135</b><br>
b. 3500<br>
c. 78.32<br>
d. 7800<br><br>

N2=Maximum equilibrium speed<br>
N=Mean speed<br>
a. (N<sub>2</sub>+N<sub>1</sub>)/N<br>
<b>b.(N<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>1</sub>)/N</b><br>
c. (N<sub>2</sub>+N<sub>1</sub>)* N<br>
d. (N<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>1</sub>)* N<br><br>
